					Halloween waste is the spookiest "trick" of them all.<br>
					"Treat" the planet right by choosing things like this instead:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>make your own costume and decorations out of reused materials</li>
				<li>roast your pumpkin seeds and eat or compost your jack-o-lantern</li>
				<li>buy packaged candy from a small/local business</li>
				<li>donate your money to a good cause. don't spend it on halloween crap. good lord.</li>
			</ul>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<td style="vertical-align: middle">
					<p><em>Look at these ghosts I made from paper I found in a recycling bin!
					C'mon!! They are so cute!!! You could make these too!!!!</em></p>
				</td>
