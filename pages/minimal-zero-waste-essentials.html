			<p>This is a revised version of a blog post for <a href="https://zerowaste.org/minimal-zero-waste-essentials">ZeroWaste.Org</a> </p>
			<h3>what is the minimal set of items you need to have a successful zero waste day?</h3>
			<h5>{</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>container for wet things (thermos/mug can handle any temperature)</li>
				<li>fabric bag for dry things (doubles as a napkin)</li>
				<li>a versatile utensil (perhaps a spork?)</li>
				<li>tote bag to hold your essentials (and other stuff too)</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>}</h5>
			<p>And I think you can do pretty well with that (as long as you're willing to occasionally <a href="impact-of-inconvenience">get a little messy</a>).</p>
