				Composting food waste is impactful and convenient. It both prevents bad things and creates good things:
			</p>
			<h4> bad things happen when you don't compost </h4>
			<ul>
				<li>organic materials that end up in landfills are buried under non-compostable trash, which prevents them from getting the oxygen they need to decompose and instead causes them to emit harmful greenhouse gasses</li>
				<li>my trash can is smelly and there are fruit flies in my apartment</li>
			</ul>

			<h4> good things happen when you compost </h4>
			<ul>
				<li>organic materials that decompose under proper oxygenated conditions turn into a rich natural fertilizer</li>
				<li>the fruit flies are gone and my trash can is emptier than ever</li>
				<li>I have a fun new routine of walking to the community compost near me</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>here is how composting works for me (4 easy steps)</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Collect food scraps</li>
				<li>Store scraps in a container (in the freezer if smelly)</li>
				<li>Drop off scraps at the community compost</li>
				<li>Rinse container and start again</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Depending on where you live, you may need to adjust step 3:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you live in a house with a yard, you can start your own compost pile or invest in a compost bin</li>
				<li>If you live somewhere that offers compost pick up services, you can have your compost collected at the curb</li>
				<li>If you don’t have a community compost nearby, you can set up a small vermicompost system that you keep indoors or on a balcony</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				I spent many years not composting, not because I didn’t want to compost but
				because I didn’t realize how convenient and worthwhile it could be.
				Now that I've figured out my composting logistics, I can’t imagine going back. I love composting!
