			<h4>some packaging is better than other packaging</h4>
			<p>
				While "no packaging" is a good ideal to strive for, it is useful prioritize types of waste you may choose to buy:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>glass, aluminum, and paper are better than plastic</li>
				<p>There are environmental costs to producing glass/aluminum/paper packaging,
					but at least the materials are more easily recycled and don't contain petrochemicals</p>
				<br>
				<li>packaging you will reuse is better than packaging you will throw away</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h4>sometimes, some packaging is better than no packaging</h4>
			<p>
				Choosing between a glass jar of olives from a small business or package-free olives
				from the olive bar at Whole Foods?
				<br>
				Get the glass jar!

			<h5>
				consider the <a href="upstream-insight.html">upstream impact</a> of your purchases
			</h5>
			<p>
				Big corportations have negative environmental (and social) upstream impacts, but supporting
				a sustainable small local business can be good for the zero waste movement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Small businesses are also more likely to take your preferences into account --
				ask if they have any low-waste packaging options.
