				"In a gift economy, wealth is understood as having enough to share, and
				the practice for dealing with abundance is to give it away. …
				You might rightly observe that we no longer live in small, insular societies,
				where generosity and mutual esteem structure our relations. But we could.
				<em style="font-weight: bold;">It is within our power</em>
				to create such webs of interdependence, quite outside the market economy.”
