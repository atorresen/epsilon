			<h3>going zero waste is NOT about the trash in your trash can.</h3>
			
			<p>Every pound of waste we throw away generated and average of <em>7-32 pounds</em> 
				of waste during its production and shipping processes.</p>
			
			<p>The most harmful extraction and emissions
				occur upstream of the consumer during manufacturing and packaging, before products
				even get to store shelves.</p>

			<h4>zero waste is about <em>decreasing demand for the production of new things</em></h4>

			<br>

			<p>Take it from <a href="https://zerowaste.org/when-convenience-meets-consciousness">ZeroWaste.Org</a>:</p>

			<blockquote>
				"We talk about upstream framing," Samuel [of ZeroWaste.Org] explains. "A really good 
				example is recycling. A lot of people jump straight to recycling as a solution, and 
				we have to debunk that and say recycling is great, compost is great, but by basically 
				a factor of ten, eliminating the purchase of something is better.
				<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #222">
					If you can reduce the purchase of one new thing, you're doing so 
					much more than throwing it away correctly.</span>"
