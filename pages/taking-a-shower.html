				bottles ↦ bars
			</h4>
			<p>
				My local coop sells package-free soap bars and paper-wrapped shampoo/conditioner bars.
				I also found a package-free shampoo bar at a farmers market. Not only did these
				products come with minimal packaging, they came from small local sources that I want
				to give my money to.
			</p>
			<h5>bars are better</h5>
			<p>
				Solid bars last a long time, since they contain more concentrated product than bottles
				(which usually contain mostly water). I've been really impressed with my shampoo bars in
				particular; a single one costs less than $10 and lasts over a year.
			</p>
			<p>
				These types of bars are often made without synthetic dyes or fragrances,
				which feels nice and clean on many levels.
			</p>
			<h3>my zero waste shower stuff:</h3>
			<p>In the shower, I use the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>bar of soap</li>
				<li>shampoo bar</li>
				<li>conditioner bar</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And that is all.</p>
