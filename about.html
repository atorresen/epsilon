			<h3>who am I?</h3>
			<p>
				I am AnneMarie, a mathematician/<wbr>artist/<wbr>teacher/<wbr>zero waste advocate.
				In 2021, I joined a two-week zero waste challenge at
				<a href="https://zerowaste.org">ZeroWaste.Org</a> and have been inspired to live as sustainably as I can ever since.

					<h3>what is ε?</h3>
					<p>
						ε is the symbol for "epsilon," a Greek letter used in mathematics
						to denote an infinitesimally small positive amount.
					</p>
					<p>
						ε is often used to show that the distance between two things is extremely small without necessarily equalling zero.
						In other words, ε is a notation that helps us represent the idea of things that are "very close" to each other.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the context of <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Epsilon-DeltaDefinition.html">proofs invoking ε</a>,
						if |x - y| < ε, then the distance between x and y is <em>close enough to zero</em> to claim that x and y are effectively the same.
					</p>
					<p>
						Math students commonly encounter ε in the definition of a "limit."
						A limit is a way of representing a trend that <em>approaches</em> a value without necessarily attaining it.

			<h3>what is zero waste?</h3>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/wiki/index/">zero waste movement</a>
				encourages people to limit consumption with the goals of reducing trash sent to landfills and,
				more importantly, reducing the environmental harm that comes from producing and shipping new stuff.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zero wasters try to avoid purchasing anything in packaging and to repair/reuse any items they already have.
			</p>
			<p>
				An effective zero waste lifestyle isn't just about "throwing away better."
				Rather, being zero waste means being aware of the environmental impacts of our daily behaviors
				and taking tangible action to make a small but significant positive difference.
			</p>

			<h3>what is waste < ε?</h3>
			<p>
				waste < ε ("waste less than epsilon") symbolizes an amount of waste approaching a very small quantity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite its name, the main goal of "zero waste" isn't exactly to make "zero" trash. Practically speaking,
				the goal is to meaningfully reduce the production of stuff so that we can <em>approach</em> zero waste.
			</p>
			<p>
				We don't need a world with literally zero trash. Rather, we strive to make any-amount-<em>less</em> trash.
				We make daily choices with the hopes of reducing waste so that it is <em>close enough to zero</em>
				to stop harming the planet.
			</p>
			<p>
				The outputs of human consumption may never equal zero, but through zero waste practices we can
				create a trend toward less trash and eventually enjoy the benefits of waste < ε.
